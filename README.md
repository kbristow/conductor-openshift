# Conductor Cpenshift
Simple example of running [Netflix Conductor](https://netflix.github.io/conductor/) in OpenShift.
This will set up the Conductor UI, Conductor Server, Elasticsearch 2.4 and and Dynomite in an OpenShift project.
This is not a production ready solution but rather a way to get Conductor running in OpenShift as a starting point.
